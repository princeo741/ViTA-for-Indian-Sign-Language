# ViTA for Indian Sign Language
 A system designed to convert Indian Sign Language in text/speach


ViTA for Indian Sign Language is a software that converts Indian Sign Language (ISL) into text and audio. This project aims to bridge the communication gap for ISL users by providing a seamless translation of sign language into spoken and written forms. The software can translate signs into three languages: English, Hindi, and Kannada.

## Features

- **Record New Gestures:** Capture and save new sign gestures.
- **Train Gestures:** Train the model with recorded gestures for accurate recognition.
- **Test Gestures:** Recognize and translate sign language in real-time.
- **Audio Output:** Convert recognized signs into audio output.
- **Multilingual Support:** Translate signs into English, Hindi, and Kannada.
- **Context Awareness:** An in-development feature that records the surroundings and suggests appropriate responses, reducing the number of actions a user has to perform.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language for the project.
- **OpenCV:** For computer vision tasks and capturing gestures.
- **MediaPipe:** For hand tracking and landmark detection.
- **NLP Model:** For interpreting signed phrases into valid text.
- **Text-to-Speech:** For audio output of recognized signs.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/princeo741/ViTA-for-Indian-Sign-Language.git
    cd ViTA-for-Indian-Sign-Language
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. **Recording New Gestures:**
    - Use the application interface to capture and save new gestures.

5. **Training the Model:**
    - Train the model with the recorded gestures for better accuracy.

6. **Testing and Real-time Recognition:**
    - Use the test module to recognize and translate gestures in real-time.

## Context Awareness (response.py)

The `response.py` module includes an experimental "Context Awareness" feature. This feature records the surrounding environment and suggests appropriate responses to ease the signing process, reducing the number of actions a user needs to perform.
